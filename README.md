# Project-Sudoku
Hello! This project was made using HTML, Javascript and CSS! This project features the Sudoku game, where you have a 9x9 grid filled with numbers and you have to introduce the correct number on the correct cell in order to solve the puzzle. There is also an indicator that will tell you how many wrong tries you did. If you place a number and realise that the counter increased then it means that the number you entered is not correct in that position. The rule for the number to be placed correctly is for it to appear only once in its corresponding row, column and 3x3 grid. The grids are separated here with black lines in order for the player to see them. There is not a specified amount of wrong tries in order for you to lose, so you have as many tries as you want. If the player places all the numbers correctly in the cells, a winning message will appear and a "Play again" button will be created that will allow the player to play the game once again. 
NOTE: In this project there is only one Sudoku puzzle and it's the same every time you restart the game.
